      <h2>Bishop Message</h2>
      <p>I hear that you are publishing a new directory of the parish and this note is to send you my wishes and prayers. I realize that it has been almost six years since you have published your directory. In the meantime, there are many who may have left their parish community due to job transfers, migrating to other countries or settled in other places due to various reasons.......</p>
      <div class="content">
            <p>It is also true many new families have come to the parish and the directory will be a good tool to help them to know the other members of the parish family.</p>
